            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> I am a Computer Engineering student at Texas A&M University with a Minor in Mathematics. I have a deep passion for accessibility, inclusive technology, and medical advancements, and I am eager to use my knowledge to build innovative solutions that make a meaningful impact. Beyond my technical interests, I actively work to support Black and Hispanic students in breaking into the tech industry by fostering mentorship, professional development, and networking opportunities. By combining my technical skills with my ability to communicate, collaborate, and mentor others, I strive to grow both as an engineer and as a person. 
			Every step I take toward becoming a computer engineer strengthens not only my expertise but also my ability to uplift and support those around me.</p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p> My interest in accessibility technology drives me to explore innovations that enhance independence and improve lives. I am particularly fascinated by: </p>
            <p> Eye-Tracking Technology – Allowing users with limited mobility to control devices with just their eyes, improving communication and digital access.</p>
            <p> Voice-Controlled Smart Assistants – Enhancing natural language processing to create more intuitive interactions, making technology more accessible to users with mobility or speech impairments.</p>
            <p> Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) Devices – Assisting individuals with speech disabilities through AI-powered symbol-based apps and text-to-speech tools. </p>
            <p> Smart Wheelchairs with AI Navigation – Integrating LiDAR, obstacle detection, and voice control to help users navigate safely and independently. </p>

            <h2>Why Engineering?</h2>
            <p>Taking on a personal project to improve electronic health records (EHRs) interoperability, 
            I dove into in-depth research and teamed up with a medical professional to grasp the industry's challenges. 
            Pitching inventive solutions, I immersed myself in software engineering, crafting prototypes to tackle the identified issues. 
            This hands-on journey exposed me to the incredible impact technology can have on healthcare, 
            igniting a genuine passion to use my computer engineering skills for positive change. 
            This project became a turning point, solidifying my dedication to a career where 
            I can contribute to significant progress where technology meets healthcare.</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p> I enjoy dancing—it’s my go-to for letting loose and having a great time. I also love fashion as a creative outlet for self-expression, and I find joy in sharing the art of dance with others. Beyond dance, I enjoy bringing creative people together and collaborating on artistic projects. I also love to sing and explore unique hobbies. Recently, I challenged myself by trying a ropes course and played a bit of racquetball. I’m always looking for new and exciting activities to push my boundaries, express myself, and have fun.
