            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p> My interest in accessibility technology drives me to explore innovations that enhance independence and improve lives. I am particularly fascinated by: </p>
            <p> Eye-Tracking Technology – Allowing users with limited mobility to control devices with just their eyes, improving communication and digital access.</p>
            <p> Voice-Controlled Smart Assistants – Enhancing natural language processing to create more intuitive interactions, making technology more accessible to users with mobility or speech impairments.</p>
            <p> Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) Devices – Assisting individuals with speech disabilities through AI-powered symbol-based apps and text-to-speech tools. </p>
            <p> Smart Wheelchairs with AI Navigation – Integrating LiDAR, obstacle detection, and voice control to help users navigate safely and independently. </p>

            <h2>Why Engineering?</h2>
            <p>Taking on a personal project to improve electronic health records (EHRs) interoperability, 
            I dove into in-depth research and teamed up with a medical professional to grasp the industry's challenges. 
            Pitching inventive solutions, I immersed myself in software engineering, crafting prototypes to tackle the identified issues. 
            This hands-on journey exposed me to the incredible impact technology can have on healthcare, 
            igniting a genuine passion to use my computer engineering skills for positive change. 
            This project became a turning point, solidifying my dedication to a career where 
            I can contribute to significant progress where technology meets healthcare.</p>
